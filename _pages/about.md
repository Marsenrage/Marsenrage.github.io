As a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Alabama, I am conducting research under my advisor, [Hongsheng He](https://eng.ua.edu/eng-directory/dr-hongsheng-he/). My research lies in intelligent robots, with an emphasis on developing context-aware, task-oriented frameworks that leverage reinforcement learning to improve the adaptability, efficiency, and robustness of robotic grasping and manipulation in unstructured environments.

Throughout my Ph.D. journey, I have made significant contributions to the field of robot learning and manipulation, as evidenced by my publications in top-tier conferences such as ICRA, Humanoids, and ICSR. My work has also been supported by the [NSF I-Corps](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2211149&HistoricalAwards=false) program for commercialization, where I served as the entrepreneurial lead, focusing on market investigation and prototype development.
