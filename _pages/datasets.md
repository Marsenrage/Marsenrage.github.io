## Task Object Grasp Dataset
The dataset was refined from the Yale grasping dataset to include:

- 74 unique tasks by merging those with similar actions,

- 15 distinct grasp topologies, reduced from an initial 31 by consolidating similar types, and

- 157 3D object models collected to match objects not originally modeled in 3D.

The dataset is availabe at [[Code](https://github.com/Marsenrage/MagicHand)]

## Near-Infared Spectra Dataset
The dataset comprises common daily-use objects for NIR analysis and includes:

- Six material categories: ceramic, wood, plastic, cardboard, stainless steel, and glass,

- Ten samples per object for spectral measurement, with ~30 scans per sample for larger items and fewer scans for smaller ones, and

- A total of 15,936 spectral samples, capturing a broad range of material characteristics for near-infrared analysis.
